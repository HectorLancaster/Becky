# The code has been split into six sections:
  # (1) Process Map Data
  # (2) Curve Fitting
  # (3) Fit Map
  # (4) Fit Histogram
  # (5) Scatter Plot
  # (6) Troubleshooter
  
# The code must be run in numerical order for it to work, as variables are defined in earlier sections and reused later on. 
# There may end up being Latex compatibility issues, if so, let me know and we can try and work them out!

# Fingers crossed...
